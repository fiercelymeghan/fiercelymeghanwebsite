<div class="about-text">
<p>Meghan Blanchette is a keynote speaker, educator, and transformation advocate who brings heart, humor, and hard-earned wisdom to every stage she steps on.</p>
<p>After overcoming years of addiction, instability, and self-doubt, Meghan rebuilt her life from the ground up—turning her story into a mission to help others reclaim their worth and step fully into who they were always meant to be.</p>
<p>She speaks to corporate teams, educators, recovery communities, and professionals across industries about the power of perseverance, emotional intelligence, and showing up fully—even (and especially) when life gets messy.</p>
<p>In addition to her speaking work, Meghan remains active in the beauty industry as an educator and platform artist, providing leadership, education, and support to salon professionals. She’s also a content creator with over 4,500 followers on TikTok, where she originally built a loyal audience through makeup, skincare, and hair tutorials. Today, she’s returning to the platform with a renewed purpose—delivering her message through “Get Ready With Me” videos that blend personal storytelling with inspiration, growth, and self-reflection.</p>
<p>When she’s not speaking or creating, Meghan finds peace in her garden and joy in the company of her two cats, Nacho and Chili Bean. She shares life with her longtime partner Daryl, whose steady presence has been part of her journey of healing and growth. Together, they’ve built a life rooted in love, laughter, and the quiet power of showing up for one another.</p>
<p>She doesn’t just speak about transformation—she lives it, and helps others believe they can too.</p>
