<p>Meghan knows firsthand what it means to face adversity â€” and what it takes to move beyond it.</p>
<p>After battling addiction and rebuilding her life in recovery, Meghan charted a professional path that reflects both personal transformation and organizational leadership. She began working for Sport Clips Haircuts while living in transitional housing during her early recovery, and over the years, grew into a leadership role as an educator and platform artist for the company.</p>
<p>Today, Meghan serves as an Area Coach and Platform Artist for Sport Clips Haircuts, where she provides operational support to franchise owners, leadership training for managers, and technical education for stylists. As one of just ten coaches nationally selected for the Sport Clips Artistic Team, she represents the brand on stage at major hair shows, contributes to industry publications, and helps shape the companyâ€™s public presence. Her personal journey and professional expertise were featured in Modern Salon Magazine in both 2022 and 2023 as part of their Mental Health Month coverage.</p>
<p>In addition to her corporate work, Meghan gives back by serving as Chairwoman of the Board of Directors for InterCommunity Health Care, a nonprofit healthcare organization providing primary care, mental health services, addiction treatment, and school-based healthcare centers across Connecticut. InterCommunity operates the very treatment center where Meghan began her own recovery journey. For nearly a decade, she has helped guide the organizationâ€™s mission, leadership, and community outreach to support long-term transformation and access to care.</p>
<p>Through keynotes, workshops, and coaching, Meghan brings her deeply personal story into the corporate world â€” helping organizations build resilient leaders, foster authentic cultures, and create safe, high-performing workplaces where people can bring their whole selves to work.</p>
<p>Her work focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership development and self-leadership</li>
<li>Resilience and navigating adversity</li>
<li>Mental wellbeing and burnout prevention</li>
<li>Team engagement and psychological safety</li>
</ul>
